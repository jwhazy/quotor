A Twitter clone using the T3 stack. This was my "learning" project for tRPC, Prisma and Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js). This is not finished, never got around to getting it done. Feel free to look around. Errors are all over the place - mainly just ESLint though. There are no production protections (rate limiting, etc).
